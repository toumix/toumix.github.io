## Hello, world!

I'm a post-doctoral researcher at [LIS, Marseille](https://www.lis-lab.fr/) where I work with [Giuseppe di Molfetta](https://www.giuseppe-dimolfetta.com/) and [Pierre Clairambault](https://pageperso.lis-lab.fr/pierre.clairambault/).
I did my PhD in the [Oxford Quantum Group](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/activities/quantum/), supervised by [Bob Coecke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Coecke) and [Dan Marsden](https://stringdiagram.com/).
I'm also part-time research scientist at [Cambridge Quantum](https://cambridgequantum.com).

My research interests include quantum computing, artificial intelligence and category theory.
Most of my recent work was focused on [DisCoCat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DisCoCat) and [quantum natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_natural_language_processing).
I am the main developer of [DisCoPy](https://discopy.org), the Python toolkit for computing with [string diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_diagram).
