## Hello, world!

I'm a research and development scientist at [PlantingSpace](https://planting.space).
I did my PhD in the [Oxford Quantum Group](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/activities/quantum/), supervised by [Bob Coecke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Coecke) and [Dan Marsden](https://stringdiagram.com/).

My research interests include applied category theory, artificial intelligence and quantum computing.
Most of my recent work was about [DisCoCat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DisCoCat) and [quantum natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_natural_language_processing).
I am the main developer of [DisCoPy](https://discopy.org), the Python toolkit for computing with [string diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_diagram).
