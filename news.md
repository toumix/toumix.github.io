## June 2024

* I was attending [ACT 2024](https://oxford24.github.io) where
  - my co-author [Giovanni](giovanni.defelice.xyz) presented our recent work on [Monoidal Streams and Probabilistic Dataflow with DisCoPy](https://oxford24.github.io/assets/act-papers/46_monoidal_streams_and_probabili.pdf)
  - I presented our joint work on [Higher-Order DisCoCat](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17813)
