## June 2024

* I was attending [ACT 2024](https://oxford24.github.io) where
  - my co-author [Giovanni](giovanni.defelice.xyz) presented our recent work on [Monoidal Streams and Probabilistic Dataflow with DisCoPy](https://oxford24.github.io/assets/act-papers/46_monoidal_streams_and_probabili.pdf)
  - I presented our joint work on [Higher-Order DisCoCat](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17813)
  - I gave a lightning talk to present PlantingSpace at the industry session, in part to advertise for an open position as [Applied Category Theorist](https://jobs.lever.co/planting.space/ee5d1545-f5b4-424f-918a-8e0b3329d266)

## December 2023

* [Tally](https://quantumtally.art/) was presented as part of the [biennale némo](https://www.biennalenemo.fr/) at [Cent Quatre Paris](https://www.104.fr/). It's the first exhibition of *quantum-enhanced generative art*, a project on which I've been working for the last two years with [Matthieu Poli](https://www.matthieupoli.com/) and [Sven Björn Fi](https://xn--svenbjrn-s4a.fi/).

## May 2023

* I started a new job at [PlantingSpace](https://planting.space) where I will be working on applied category theory for natural language processing and artificial intelligence.

## December 2022

* My PhD thesis is now available on the [arXiv:2212.06615](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06615).
* DisCoPy v1.0 got released on [GitHub](https://github.com/discopy/discopy).

## October 2022

* I started a postdoc at [LIS, Marseille](https://www.lis-lab.fr/) where I will work on formal methods for distributed quantum computing.

## May 2022

* I successfully defended my D.Phil. thesis! [Sam Staton](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/samuel.staton/main.html) and [Michael Moortgat](https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/MJMoortgat) were my examiners.
