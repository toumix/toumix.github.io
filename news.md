## November 2022

* I'm looking for an intern to work on [text summarisation with quantum natural language processing](jobs/22-11-16-qnlp-summarisation).
* This website went from from hand-written html to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

## October 2022

* I started a postdoc at [LIS, Marseille](https://www.lis-lab.fr/) where I will work on formal methods for distributed quantum computing.

## May 2022

* I successfully defended my D.Phil. thesis! [Sam Staton](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/samuel.staton/main.html) and [Michael Moortgat](https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/MJMoortgat) were my examiners.
