# Text Summarisation with Quantum Natural Language Processing (Internship)

---

## Context

[Quantum natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_natural_language_processing) (QNLP) is the use of quantum computing to solve NLP tasks faster than any classical computer.

In a recent approach[^Coe20], text is represented as parameterised circuits that are optimised using a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm. This approach was implemented on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware, with promising experimental results on text classification and question answering.

## Objective

The aim of the internship is to apply QNLP to the problem of **automatic text summarisation**.[^DF09]

The student will design quantum algorithms, investigate their asymptotic speedup compared to classical ones and implement proof-of-concept experiments to evaluate them.

## Supervision

The internship will be hosted at the [Laboratoire d'Informatique & Syst√®mes](https://www.lis-lab.fr/) in Marseille, supervised by:

* [Alexis Toumi](https://alexis.toumi.xyz)
* [Benoit Favre](https://pageperso.lis-lab.fr/benoit.favre/)
* [Giuseppe di Molfetta](https://www.giuseppe-dimolfetta.com/)

## Application

Send an email to the people above with:

* a CV
* a cover letter
* an academic transcript
